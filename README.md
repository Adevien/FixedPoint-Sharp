# FixedPoint-Sharp

## Features
- LUT-based trigonometry
- 48.16 precision
- 2D and 3D vector types
- 1D, 2D, 3D math
- Random generator for fp, int and bool (Vector types will be added a bit later)
- A huge pile of tests

## Defines
- `FIXNUM_STRIP_LUTS` allows you to strip all luts in case if you don't need trigonometry. It will save you some memory. (LUTS take around 16mb)

## WIP
- Matrix, Quaternion type
- Transformation math
